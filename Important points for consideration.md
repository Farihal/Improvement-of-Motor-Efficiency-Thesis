##  Rotor OD & Stator OD
Most all new design tasks of new machines begin with a known or
given maximum stator core diameter.
Start the design with an assumed rotor diameter based upon the
number of poles from chart below.

| Poles   	| 2  	| 4  	| 6  	| 8  	| 10 	| 12 	|
|---------	|----	|----	|----	|----	|----	|----	|
| R/S (%) 	| 50 	| 53 	| 56 	| 60 	| 65 	| 70 	|
