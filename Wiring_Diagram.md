Important short-notes from [an answer given on quora](https://qr.ae/TW8jUz)

The windings used in rotating electrical machines can be classified as

 Concentrated Windings

• All the winding turns are wound together in series to form one multi-turn coil

• All the turns have the same magnetic axis

• Examples of concentrated winding are – field windings for salient-pole synchronous machines – D.C. machines – Primary and secondary windings of a transformer

 Distributed Windings

• All the winding turns are arranged in several full-pitch or fractional-pitch coils

• These coils are then housed in the slots spread around the air-gap periphery to form phase or commutator winding

• Examples of distributed winding are – Stator and rotor of induction machines – The armatures of both synchronous and D.C. machines

Armature windings, in general, are classified under two main heads, namely,

 Closed Windings

• There is a closed path in the sense that if one starts from any point on the winding and traverses it, one again reaches the starting point from where one had started

• Used only for D.C. machines and A.C. commutator machines

 Open Windings

• Open windings terminate at suitable number of slip-rings or terminals

• Used only for A.C. machines, like synchronous machines, induction machines, etc
