## Target
To replace diesel engines used in shallow boats with PMSM (permanant magnet synchronus motor).

## Application of Diesel Engines
In Bangladesh , Diesel Engines are used in diverse applications such as- Nosimon, Pump, Sugarcane Juicer, Small Boat, Cultivation , Troller, Saw Mill, Rice Mill, Wheat Mill, Brick Crusher, Rice Mill etc. The problems with these engines are-

- Engine efficiency is very low , approximately 35-40%
- Poor power-to-weight ratio with a normal 4 HP diesel engine weighing around 60 Kg
- Most of the commercial diesel engine-run machines not maintained properly, thus causing huge air pollution.
- Major part of this pollution is caused by starting of the engine ; at low speed diesel engine has very poor efficiency.
- “Currently, sulphur content in imported diesel is 500 ppm,” says Professor Mohammed Ehsan, a teacher of mechanical engineering at the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology. A decade ago it was several thousand ppm. “But the problem is that unscrupulous traders mix various impurities with the diesel and petrol, so vehicles using these adulterated fuels spew out more pollutants.”
- The diesel engines used in the boats pollute the water bodies along with the surrounding environment.

## Application of Electric motor in boats
- [x] In Italy , two 8 KW high efficient PMSM motor were equipped to a tourist boat that ran on solar power. The boat was 14 m x 5.50 m with a maximum speed of 8 knots and a cruising range of 6 hrs.
- [x] In Malaysia, a 48V 9 KW BLDC has been used to run a small catamaran. The efficiency of the motor is 93% and operates for 12 hours a day.
- [x] In Thailand , a 3-phase 2.2 KW squirrel cage induction motor (IM) was used in the outboard electric propulsion system of a mono hull boat. The maximum speed the boat could rich was 5 knots within 1 kilometer distance. 
- [x] In Bangladesh , a 48V , 500 W BLDC motor has been used to drive a 6.5mx2m solar boat capable of carrying 1200 Kg load for 8 hrs. For this load , the theoretically calculated power requirement is 380 W. The approximate speed of the boat is measured at 3knots, which is capable of covering 60 Km distance in one full charge. Rated speed of the motor is 2800 rpm , rated torque 1.7 Nm and efficiency 75%. In field test , the motor used 450-455 W and achieved 950-970 rpm speed.

# Thesis Objective
- To design a PM DC electric motor for a diesel-electric hybrid drive / standalone electric drive in applications such as Nosimon, Pump, Sugarcane Juicer, Small Boat, Cultivation , Troller, Saw Mill, Rice Mill, Wheat Mill, Brick Crusher, Rice Mill etc
- Speed of the motor should be  `2000-3000` rpm.
- The shaft torque must be constant over a large speed range.
- A high starting torque
- Air gap is considered `0.7 mm` , a practical value.
- Slot factor is `36% - 40%`, practical consideration.
- Wire can be of `Cu` or `Al`.
- Current density in the wires is to be kept within `5A/sq.mm`.
- High power-to-weight ratio
- High efficiency (`>90%`) and high power factor
- Flux distribution in different parts of the machine to be kept within limit.
- Discussion on Torque constant, `K<sub>t</sub>` and Voltage constant, `K<sub>e</sub>`

I will also present a comparative analysis of the rotor topologies which are widely used for EV (Electric Vehicle) applications- `Standard` , `V type`, `V type double layer` and `Delta shape`.
