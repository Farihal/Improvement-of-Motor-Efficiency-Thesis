## Target
To replace diesel engines used in shallow boats with PMSM (permanant magnet synchronus motor).

## Application of Diesel Engines
In Bangladesh , Diesel Engines are used in diverse applications such as- Nosimon, Pump, Sugarcane Juicer, Small Boat, Cultivation , Troller, Saw Mill, Rice Mill, Wheat Mill, Brick Crusher, Rice Mill etc. The problems with these engines are-

- Engine efficiency is very low , approximately 35-40%
- Poor power-to-weight ratio with a normal 4 HP diesel engine weighing around 60 Kg
- Most of the commercial diesel engine-run machines not maintained properly, thus causing huge air pollution.
- Major part of this pollution is caused by starting of the engine ; at low speed diesel engine has very poor efficiency.
- “Currently, sulphur content in imported diesel is 500 ppm,” says Professor Mohammed Ehsan, a teacher of mechanical engineering at the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology. A decade ago it was several thousand ppm. “But the problem is that unscrupulous traders mix various impurities with the diesel and petrol, so vehicles using these adulterated fuels spew out more pollutants.”
- The diesel engines used in the boats pollute the water bodies along with the surrounding environment.

## Application of Electric motor in boats
[1] In Italy , two 8 KW high efficient PMSM motor were equipped to a tourist boat that ran on solar power. The boat was 14 m x 5.50 m with a maximum speed of 8 knots and a cruising range of 6 hrs.
